# Test App

This application displays population of the biggest and smallest countries.
Due to requerements of using npx this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Additional dependencies:
- typescript
- typestyle (easy to use, zero performance impact plus type safe css)
- react-collapsible (due to requerement to use open source library component for collapsible functionality)

Custom countries are being kept in local storage and will be added to the initial state on page reload.
